# MyCaffe Mean Error Sample
MyCaffe Mean Error Loss sample solves a simple regression problem using either Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculates the means squared difference between the target and predicted values.  The following simple model uses the MSE loss function.  To enable, select option '1' when running the sample.

When running the sample and selecting '1' for MSE, the following results are produced but will differ given your compute speed, etc.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculates the mean absolute difference between the target and predicted values.  The following simple model uses the MAE loss function.  To enable, select option '2' when running the sample.
