# MyCaffe Loss Samples

The samples in this area cover various types of loss functions including the following:

**[Regression](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Loss/MeanErrorLoss/MeanErrorLoss)** - regression loss functions, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to learn single values and are used to solve time-series and other regression problems.

**[Binary Classification](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Loss/BinaryClassificationLoss/BinaryClassificationLoss)** - binary classification loss functions are used to solve 2-class problems.  For example, does an image contain a cat, or not?

**[Multi-Class Classification](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Loss/MultiClassClassificationLoss/MultiClassClassificationLoss)** - multi-class classification loss functions are used to solver n-class problems.  For example, determining the character value of a handwritten digit is a multi-class problem.

**[Multi-Label Classification](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Loss/MultiLabelClassificationLoss/MultiLabelClassificationLoss)** - multi-label classification loss function solves multi-label problems.  For example, determining the attributes of a handwritten image is a multi-label problem.
