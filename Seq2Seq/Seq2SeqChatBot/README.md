<H2>Welcome to the Seq2Seq MyCaffe-Samples!</H2>

This chat-bot sample provides a MyCaffe Sequence-to-Sequence model that encodes the inputs from a questioner and maps the probabilities to the encoding
of the chat-bot and uses attention to learn the link between the two.  This sample is a re-write of the original open-source sample Seq2SeqLearn from 
[mashmawy/Seq2SeqLearn](https://github.com/mashmawy/Seq2SeqLearn) distributed under MIT license and the chat-bot sample from
[HectorPulido/Chatbot-seq2seq-C-](https://github.com/HectorPulido/Chatbot-seq2seq-C-) also distributed under [MIT license](https://github.com/HectorPulido/Chatbot-seq2seq-C-/blob/master/LICENSE).
