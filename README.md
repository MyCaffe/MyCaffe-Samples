# MyCaffe-Samples
The MyCaffe-Samples include numerous sample applications that show how to use MyCaffe and are organized under the following topics:

<b>[BlobUsage](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/BlobUsage)</b> demonstrates how to load and manipulate blobs of data stored in GPU memory.

<b>[CudaDnn/CudaDnnTest](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/CudaDnn/CudaDnnTest)</b> demonstrates how to use GPU memory, including memory pointers.

<b>[ImageClassification](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/ImageClassification)</b> demonstrates various ways of loading image data and training simple image classification problems.

<b>[MemoryDataLayer](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/MemoryDataLayer)</b> demonstrates how to use the MemoryDataLayer.

<b>[OneShotLearning](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/OneShotLearning)</b> demonstrates how to perform one-shot learning on small datasets using the Siamese network.  A separate sample demonstrates how to train these
models using Python.

<b>[OnnxExamples](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/OnnxExamples)</b> demonstrates how to use the OnnxControl to load [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) model files.

<b>[ReinforcementLearning](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning)</b> demonstrates how to implement a reinforcement learning solution to solve the Cart-Pole gym by programming MyCaffe using Python.

<b>[Seq2Seq](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Seq2Seq)</b> has several demonstrations that show how to learn a Sin curve using an encoder/decoder model and also how to learn a Sin curve using MNIST hand-written
characters that are associated with different parts of the Sin curve.

<b>[Loss](https://github.com/MyCaffe/MyCaffe-Samples/tree/master/Loss)</b> has several demonstrations that show how to use the various loss functions to solve regresssion, binary classification, multi-class classification and multi-label classification problems.
