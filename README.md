# MyCaffe-Samples
The MyCaffe-Samples include numerous sample applications that show how to use MyCaffe and are organized under the following topics:

<b>BlobUsage</b> demonstrates how to load and manipulate blobs of data stored in GPU memory.

<b>CudaDnn/CudaDnnTest</b> demonstrates how to use GPU memory, including memory pointers.

<b>ImageClassification</b> demonstrates various ways of loading image data and training simple image classification problems.

<b>MemoryDataLayer</b> demonstrates how to use the MemoryDataLayer.

<b>OneShotLearning</b> demonstrates how to perform one-shot learning on small datasets using the Siamese network.  A separate sample demonstrates how to train these
models using Python.

<b>OnnxEeamples</b> demonstrates how to use the OnnxControl to load [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) model files.

<b>ReinforcementLearning> demonstrates how to implement a reinforcement learning solution to solve the Cart-Pole gym by programming MyCaffe using Python.

<b>Seq2Seq</b> has several demonstrations that show how to learn a Sin curve using an encoder/decoder model and also how to learn a Sin curve using MNIST hand-written
characters that are associated with different parts of the Sin curve.
